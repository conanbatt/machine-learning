## Goodreads: Genre Classification

The goodreads challenge has a training data set that includes titles, descriptions and categories for books. 

We want you to build an api or a command line that provided a new book title or description, it predicts which category the book belongs to.

The command line or API will be used in separate data set by your interviewer.

### Evaluation
